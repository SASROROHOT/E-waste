            <h2>What Happens to Old Electronics?</h2>
            <div class="flex">
                <div>
                    <p>Many consumers store unused electronic devices at home, either as 
                        backups or due to uncertainty about proper disposal methods. In Finland, surveys show that up to 85% of users store their old mobile phones at home until a possible future use, despite the proximity and convenience of current waste management systems .
                         Additionally, a study in Mar del Plata, Argentina, found that 46.9% of electronic devices in disuse were stored, with some individuals leaving them in public spaces or alongside domestic solid waste </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, studies show that proper recycling is often the least common option, with most devices either stored indefinitely or disposed of improperly.</p>

                <div class="carte">
                    <h3>Lack of Awareness</h3>
                    <p>Many consumers don't know about the environmental dangers of improper e-waste disposal or the options available for recycling.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Electronics are thrown in regular trash or left in storage.</p>

                <div class="carte">
                    <h3>Inconvenience</h3>
                    <p>Recycling facilities may be far away or have limited operating hours, making proper disposal difficult.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> People choose easier but environmentally harmful options.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="carte">
                    <h3>Data Security Concerns</h3>
                    <p>Fear that personal data might be accessed from disposed devices deters people from recycling electronics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Devices are stored indefinitely "just in case."</p>

                <div class="carte">
                    <h3>Perceived Value</h3>
                    <p>Consumers often keep outdated devices because they believe they still have value or could be useful someday.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Accumulation of unused electronics in homes.</p>

            <div class="flex">
                <div>
                    <p>When electronic waste isn't properly recycled, it often ends up in developing countries where informal recycling occurs under dangerous conditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Toxic chemicals leach into soil and water supplies</li>
                        <li>Workers (including children) expose themselves to harmful substances</li>
                        <li>Valuable materials are recovered inefficiently</li>
                        <li>Unusable components are burned, releasing toxins into the air</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Communities near e-waste dumping grounds face serious health issues including respiratory problems, skin diseases, and increased cancer rates.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Electronic waste contains numerous harmful substances that damage the environment:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lead and mercury from circuit boards and displays</li>
                        <li>Cadmium from rechargeable batteries</li>
                        <li>Brominated flame retardants from plastic casings</li>
                        <li>Chlorofluorocarbons from older cooling equipment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When these substances enter the environment through improper disposal, they can persist for decades, contaminating ecosystems and entering the food chain.</p>
