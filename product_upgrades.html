            <div class="flex">
                <div>
                    <p>The desire to own the latest technology drives consumers to frequently replace their devices, even when current ones are still functional. In the UK, 
                        28% of phone users replace their devices every one to two years, with 40% of individuals aged 18 to 24 doing so within two years . This constant upgrading contributes significantly to the accumulation of e-waste.</p>
                    <p>What was once a purchase lasting many years has become a constant cycle of replacement, creating a significant environmental impact.</p>

            <h2>Innovation vs. Waste</h2>
            <div class="flex">
                <div>
                    <p>The tech industry faces a challenging balance between driving innovation and creating unnecessary waste. While technological advancement is important, many product upgrades offer minimal improvements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Incremental performance increases that most users don't notice</li>
                        <li>Minor design changes that don't improve functionality</li>
                        <li>New features that could have been delivered via software updates</li>
                        <li>Marketing-driven releases rather than genuine innovation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This raises the question: How much of our e-waste problem stems from necessary progress versus manufactured demand?</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The environmental cost of frequent upgrades is substantial:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raw material extraction (including rare earth minerals)</li>
                        <li>Manufacturing energy consumption and emissions</li>
                        <li>Transportation pollution from global supply chains</li>
                        <li>Waste created from discarded devices</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Manufacturing a single smartphone produces approximately 60kg of CO2 equivalentâ€”about the same as driving a car for 388 kilometers. When multiplied by billions of devices, the impact becomes enormous.</p>
