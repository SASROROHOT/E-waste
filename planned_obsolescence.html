            <h2>What is Planned Obsolescence?</h2>
            <div class="flex">
                <div>
                    <p>Planned obsolescence is a strategy where products are intentionally designed 
                        to have a limited lifespan, compelling consumers to replace them more frequently. 
                        In the tech industry, this often manifests through rapid software updates that older devices cannot support, leading to diminished performance and functionality.
                        For instance, Apple's 2017 admission that it deliberately slowed down older iPhone batteries sparked widespread criticism and highlighted how such practices can accelerate e-waste generation</p>

            <h2>Types of Planned Obsolescence</h2>
            <div class="griglia">
                <div class="carte">
                    <h3>Technical Obsolescence</h3>
                    <p>Products are designed to break down or stop functioning after a certain period or amount of use.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Batteries that cannot be replaced, forcing replacement of the entire device.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="carte">
                    <h3>Programmed Obsolescence</h3>
                    <p>Software updates that slow down older models or make them incompatible with new applications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Smartphones that become sluggish after operating system updates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="carte">
                    <h3>Psychological Obsolescence</h3>
                    <p>Marketing strategies that make consumers feel their perfectly functional products are outdated or unfashionable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Yearly smartphone models with minimal actual improvements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="carte">
                    <h3>Systemic Obsolescence</h3>
                    <p>Making repairs difficult or more expensive than buying a new product.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Devices designed to be difficult to open or repair without specialized tools.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <div class="impact-container">
                <div>
                    <p>Planned obsolescence directly contributes to the growing e-waste crisis in several ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased waste generation as functional devices are discarded</li>
                        <li>Higher resource consumption for manufacturing new products</li>
                        <li>Energy consumption and pollution from production processes</li>
                        <li>Toxic materials in landfills when devices are improperly disposed of</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When electronics are replaced every 1-2 years instead of lasting 5-10 years, the environmental impact is multiplied several times over.</p>
                </div>

            <h2>Case Study: Smartphones</h2>
            <div class="flex">
                <div>
                    <p>Smartphones represent one of the clearest examples of planned obsolescence in action:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-replaceable batteries that degrade over time</li>
                        <li>Operating system updates that slow down older models</li>
                        <li>Increasingly difficult and costly repairs</li>
                        <li>Annual release cycles with minimal essential improvements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The average smartphone is now replaced every 2-3 years, though the hardware could potentially function for 5+ years with proper design and support.</p>
